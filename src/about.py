        ## Moat is not a budgeting app.
        ### It's a decision system for operators.

        ### 🎯 What We Do Differently
        
        **Most tools track money.**  
        Moat tracks **strategic position**.
        
        We don't optimize expenses.  
        We identify where you're exposed.

        ### 🧠 The Philosophy
        
        Financial resilience isn't about having more money.  
        It's about maintaining **optionality when variables shift**.
        
        Moat helps you:
        - **Identify** structural vulnerabilities before they cascade
        - **Simulate** decisions before committing capital or time
        - **Build** defensive positions that compound
