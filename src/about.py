        ## Moat is not a budgeting app.
        ### It's a decision system for financial resilience.

        ### 🎯 What We Do Differently
        
        **Most tools track money.**  
        Moat tracks **defensibility**.
        
        We don't optimize expenses.  
        We optimize **strategic positioning**.

        ### 🧠 The Philosophy
        
        Financial resilience isn't about having more money.  
        It's about having **optionality when things change**.
        
        Moat helps you:
        - **Identify** where you're vulnerable
        - **Simulate** decisions before making them
        - **Build** leverage that compounds over time
